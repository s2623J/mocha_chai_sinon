    Notes:
    ------
    Modules:    Every module should have a suite of unit tests
    TDD:        Test Driven Development

    Mocha Workflow:
        Red:    Write a test and make it fail
        Green:  Make test pass with minimal code
        Amber:  Cleanup, re-run tests, don't change behavior

    Every Suite will be encapsulated by a describe function taking two parameters - a string, 
        and function. ie:
            describe('Addition Tests', function() {
                
            })
    
    Chai Chains:
        Symantec word chain examples and docs can be found at the Chai Assertion Library 

    Sinon:
        Creates a fake server to serve specified data to emulate/test client responses
        Spies:  Check that specified functions are called with specified parameters 
        Stub:   Fake object
        Mocks:  Fake method
